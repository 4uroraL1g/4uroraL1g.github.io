The report should be view in 200% resolution or full screen resolution for a better look.

The fixed csv file will be named at bank_delete_NaN, bank_fill_next and bank_fill_pre instead of bank1, bank2 and bank3
because it will make me easier to follow and work with.

There are two version of "bank" file, one is txt file and other is csv file. 
In this assignment I use the txt file to import and work, while save the final product to csv file.
If you want to run and test it, please remember to download all these file to have a good testing time.
